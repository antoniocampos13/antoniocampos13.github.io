Hi! I am Antonio Victor Campos Coelho and this is my website. Here I showcase my portfolio, which is a compilation of Python, R, Unix and other programming languages codes I developed for data analysis, statistical analysis and Bioinformatics. The corresponding GitHub repository where I deposited all code shown here is located [here](https://github.com/antoniocampos13/portfolio). Go check it out!

I got my Ph.D. in Genetics at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil in 2017. I am a post-doc researcher involved with a  project focused on whole-genome sequencing in the context of rare diseases diagnosis, exploring my great interest in Genetics and Biostatistics. Previously, I studied genetic factors related to HIV-1 infection, treatment (especially pharmacogenetic pathways), and therapeutic vaccine outcomes. I also participated in studies about Zika virus infection.
