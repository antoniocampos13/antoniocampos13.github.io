Hi! I am Antonio Victor Campos Coelho and this is my website. Here I showcase my portfolio, which is a compilation of Python, R, Unix and other programming languages which I developed for data analysis.

I am involved with scientific projects focused in understanding the genetic factors related to HIV-1 infection, treatment, and therapeutic vaccine outcomes, exploring my great interest in Genetics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics and contributing to a better elucidation of viral, immunological and pharmacogenetics pathways involved in HIV-1 infection. I also have been contributing to studies pertaining to Zika virus infection. 

This website is made with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), a Python-based blogging platform that works well with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). To check my code repositories from my projects and selected papers, go to https://github.com/antoniocampos13 .
