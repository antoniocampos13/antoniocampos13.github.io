Hi! I am Antonio Victor Campos Coelho and this is my website. Here I showcase my portfolio, which is a compilation of Python, R, Unix and other programming languages which I developed for data analysis. The corresponding GitHub repository where I deposited all code shown here is located [here](https://github.com/antoniocampos13/portfolio). Go check it out!

I got my PhD in Genetics at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil in 2017. I am involved with scientific projects focused in understanding the genetic factors related to HIV-1 infection, treatment, and therapeutic vaccine outcomes, exploring my great interest in Genetics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics and contributing to a better elucidation of viral, immunological and pharmacogenetics pathways involved in HIV-1 infection. I also have been contributing to studies pertaining to Zika virus infection.
